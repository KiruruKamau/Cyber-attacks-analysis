## 🔍 Project Goals
Identify and visualize the most common cyberattack types

Understand which threats (e.g., phishing, malware) are most frequent and impactful.

Assess the financial impact of cyber incidents

Quantify and compare losses across attack types, vulnerabilities, and industries.

Analyze industry-specific and regional vulnerabilities

Determine which sectors and countries are most affected by attacks.

Evaluate resolution efficiency

Examine average incident resolution times across different contexts (e.g., attack type, industry, defense mechanism).

Reveal the relationships between attack vectors and defense mechanisms

Use drill-down tools to explore how threats evolve and how organizations respond.

Enable interactive exploration of cybersecurity trends

Provide filters and dynamic visuals to help users explore patterns by year, country, industry, and more.
